## Toggles
* F7 : GlowESP
* F8 : NoFlash
* F9 : BHop

## TriggerKey
Bind your own key to alt1:
bind yourkey +alt1

## Notes
* Requires Xlib (both `libx11-dev:i386` and `libx11-dev`, `# apt-get install libx11-dev libx11-dev:i386` on Debian based systems
* Bind the key `K` to `+jump` in order to use the BHop

## Known Bugs
* Toggles do not work with Numlock enabled.
* Trigger doesn't work at far distance
* Bhop hack still listens and spams even outside of the game
